\section{Introduction}
This is a graphical user interface for generation of configuration files for the CAEN
WaveDump software. For now, it contains ONLY the configuration options that are
available for all the CAEN digitizers (particularly because I am able to test it on the
N6720A board only). Also it doesn't contain the register's operations yet.
